It also introduces a tool for quantification and qualification of risk.</p>
<h1 id="mitre-attck-techniques-tactics-subtechniques-and-procedures">MITRE ATT&amp;CK: Techniques, Tactics, Subtechniques, and Procedures</h1>
<p>MITRE ATT&amp;CK (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) is a framework used to categorize the actions and behaviors of cyber adversaries. It is structured into several components, including:</p>
<h2 id="tactics">Tactics</h2>
<p>Tactics represent high-level objectives or goals that adversaries aim to achieve during a cyberattack. These objectives are categorized into various areas:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Initial Access:</strong> This tactic encompasses techniques used by adversaries to gain their initial foothold in a target environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Execution:</strong> Under this tactic, adversaries execute malicious code on a target system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Persistence:</strong> Techniques related to maintaining access to a compromised system are covered here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Privilege Escalation:</strong> Adversaries seek to gain higher levels of access or privilege on the target system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Defense Evasion:</strong> Techniques that help adversaries avoid detection or thwart security mechanisms fall under this tactic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Credential Access:</strong> Adversaries aim to steal, collect, or abuse credentials for further actions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> The discovery tactic includes methods used to gain information about the target environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lateral Movement:</strong> This tactic involves techniques used by adversaries to move laterally within a network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Collection:</strong> Techniques used to gather and exfiltrate information are categorized here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Command and Control:</strong> Adversaries establish and maintain control over compromised systems using this tactic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Exfiltration:</strong> Adversaries attempt to remove data from the target environment under this tactic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong> Techniques that disrupt or damage systems and data are found in this category.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="techniques">Techniques</h2>
<p>Techniques are specific methods or procedures that adversaries use to achieve the objectives defined by tactics. These are detailed actions that adversaries take during an attack. For example, &ldquo;Spearphishing Attachment&rdquo; is a technique under the &ldquo;Initial Access&rdquo; tactic.</p>
<h2 id="subtechniques">Subtechniques</h2>
<p>Subtechniques are further refinements of techniques. They provide more specific details about how a technique can be executed. Subtechniques allow for a more granular understanding of adversary behavior.</p>
<p>For example, &ldquo;Spearphishing Attachment&rdquo; might have subtechniques like &ldquo;Malicious Word Document as Attachment&rdquo; or &ldquo;Malicious PDF Attachment&rdquo; to describe different attack vectors within that technique.</p>
<h2 id="procedures">Procedures</h2>
<p>Procedures represent detailed steps or implementations of specific techniques or subtechniques. They provide insights into how adversaries execute a particular technique in practice. These procedures can be specific to threat actor groups or campaigns and often include tools, tactics, and other contextual information.</p>
<p>Understanding MITRE ATT&amp;CK&rsquo;s hierarchy of tactics, techniques, subtechniques, and procedures is crucial for cybersecurity professionals to detect, defend against, and respond to real-world cyber threats.</p>

<h2 id="related-countermeasure-techniques">Related Countermeasure Techniques</h2>
<p>This table represents considerations for the modeling and defensive mesasures across the technology stack. There are countless combinations to consider. Don&rsquo;t overburden yourself, pick a few components and understand them before you move on to somethjing else.</p>
<p>The Govern Section, provides where you should have documentaiton written, this can come in a variety of forms. Databases, physical print, but the important component is that the information exists and is accessibile for the teams.</p>
<p>In the modeling column, consider this as a component where you can measure and model based on the risk assessment framework that you have implemented.</p>
<p>Considerations for modeling and data analysis should consider these structures.</p>
<h1 id="levels-of-measurement-and-quantifying-data">Levels of Measurement and Quantifying Data</h1>
<p>When dealing with data, it&rsquo;s essential to understand the levels of measurement, which determine the type of data you are working with and the mathematical operations you can perform on that data. There are four commonly recognized levels of measurement: Nominal, Ordinal, Interval, and Ratio. Let&rsquo;s explore these levels with examples drawn from the cybersecurity domain:</p>
<h2 id="1-nominal">1. Nominal</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Nominal data is the simplest level of measurement and deals with categories or labels. In this level, data is classified into distinct groups with no inherent order or numerical value. Nominal data often represents qualitative attributes or categorical variables.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Examples (Cybersecurity):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tactics:</strong> Initial Access, Execution, Persistence</li>
<li><strong>File Types:</strong> PDF, Word Document, Excel Spreadsheet</li>
<li><strong>User Roles:</strong> Admin, Analyst, Guest</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Quantification:</strong> Nominal data is typically quantified using counts or frequencies. You can count the number of occurrences of each category, but mathematical operations like addition or subtraction are not meaningful.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-ordinal">2. Ordinal</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Ordinal data includes categories that have a meaningful order or ranking but have unequal intervals between them. The differences between values do not have consistent meaning. Ordinal data allows you to compare data points in terms of greater than, less than, or equal to but not to determine the exact differences between them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Examples (Cybersecurity):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Threat Levels:</strong> Low, Moderate, High, Critical</li>
<li><strong>Severity Ratings:</strong> Low, Medium, High</li>
<li><strong>User Privileges:</strong> Read-Only, Read-Write, Administrator</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Quantification:</strong> Ordinal data can be quantified using ranking or ordering. You can determine the relative position of data points concerning each other, such as identifying which is greater or lesser. However, mathematical operations like addition or multiplication are not meaningful.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3-interval">3. Interval</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Interval data includes ordered categories with equal intervals between them. Unlike ordinal data, interval data allows meaningful comparisons of the differences between data points because the intervals are consistent. However, it lacks a true zero point, meaning that values can be negative or zero, but not undefined.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Examples (Cybersecurity):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Time:</strong> Timestamps</li>
<li><strong>Software Version Numbers:</strong> 2.0, 3.0, 4.0</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Quantification:</strong> Interval data can be quantified using numerical values, and you can perform mathematical operations like addition and subtraction on these values. However, since there is no true zero, ratios and multiplicative operations are not meaningful.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="4-ratio">4. Ratio</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Ratio data is the most advanced level of measurement, characterized by ordered categories with equal intervals and a true zero point. Ratio data allows for meaningful comparisons, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of data points.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Examples (Cybersecurity):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Count of Security Incidents</strong></li>
<li><strong>Response Time (in seconds)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Network Bandwidth (in megabits per second)</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Quantification:</strong> Ratio data is quantified using numerical values, and you can perform all mathematical operations on these values because they have a true zero point. This allows for the calculation of ratios, proportions, and meaningful comparisons.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Understanding the level of measurement of your cybersecurity data is crucial when selecting appropriate statistical methods and visualizations to analyze and interpret your data effectively.</p>

<p>Fundamentally computers function in the same manner, there are considerations based on how these components work together, understanding the fundamental approach to systems engineering, and computer science will align you to understand that there are activites that occur when a user interacts with a system. This next section explores the components you should become familiar with to more clearly align your detection engineering process</p>
<p>This is a simplified approach to highlighting common terminology that will keep you team communicating with language that you all understand.</p>
<h3 id="dns-lookup">DNS Lookup</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> A Domain Name System (DNS) lookup is a record returned from a DNS resolver after querying a DNS name server. Typically considered an A or AAAA record, where a domain name is resolved to an IPv4 or IPv6 address, respectively.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="command">Command</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> In computing, a command is a directive to a computer program acting as an interpreter of some kind, to perform a specific task. Most commonly, a command is either a directive to some kind of command-line interface, such as a shell, or an event in a graphical user interface triggered by the user selecting an option in a menu.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="resource-access">Resource Access</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> Ephemeral digital artifact comprising a request of a resource and any response from that resource.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="system-call">System Call</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> A system call is the programmatic way in which a computer program requests a service from the kernel of the operating system it is executed on. This may include hardware-related services (for example, accessing a hard disk drive), creation and execution of new processes, and communication with integral kernel services such as process scheduling. System calls provide an essential interface between a process and the operating system.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="user-action">User Action</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> An action performed by a user. Executing commands, granting permissions, and accessing resources are examples of user actions.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="relationships">Relationships</h1>
<p>This section explains the relationships of the Attack and Defend matricies. A technique will require an understanding of how the system functions and operates.
Spend time creating diagrams and relationship dependencies to determine what technique is the appropriate technique based on your knowledge, skills and abilities.</p>
