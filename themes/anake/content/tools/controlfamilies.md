# Control Families

Control families in information security standards like NIST SP 800-53 and ISO 27001 represent a structured approach to safeguarding critical assets and ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive information. These control families are essential for establishing and maintaining robust security practices within an organization.
