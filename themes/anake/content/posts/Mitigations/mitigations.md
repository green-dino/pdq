ACTIONS TO TAKE TODAY TO MITIGATE MALICIOUS CYBER ACTIVITY:
Continuously remove and disable accounts and groups from the enterprise that are no longer needed, especially privileged accounts.
Enable and enforce multifactor authentication with strong passwords.
Store credentials in a secure manner, such as with a credential manager, vault, or other privilege account management solution.


# Understanding and Mitigating LDAP Query Threats in Active Directory Environments

LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is a widely used protocol for accessing and managing directory information services. In Active Directory environments, LDAP queries are frequently employed by system administrators to retrieve information about users, computers, and other objects within the domain. However, these same queries can also be leveraged by threat actors to gather valuable reconnaissance data for potential attacks. In this article, we'll delve into some common LDAP queries conducted by threat actors and discuss strategies for mitigating the associated risks.

## LDAP Queries Conducted by Threat Actors

### 1. Collecting User Information

**LDAP Query:**
```
LDAP Search Scope: WholeSubtree
Base Object: dc=[REDACTED],dc=local
Search Filter: (objectCategory=CN=Person,CN=Schema,CN=Configuration,DC=[REDACTED],DC=local)
```
**Description:**
This query is designed to collect names and metadata of users in the domain. By retrieving this information, threat actors can gain insights into the structure of the organization and potentially identify high-value targets.

### 2. Gathering Host Information

**LDAP Query:**
```
LDAP Search Scope: WholeSubtree
Base Object: dc=[REDACTED],dc=local
Search Filter: (objectCategory=CN=Computer,CN=Schema,CN=Configuration,DC=[REDACTED],DC=local)
```
**Description:**
Similar to the previous query, this one aims to gather names and metadata, but specifically for hosts in the domain. Knowledge of the network infrastructure can aid threat actors in planning lateral movement and targeted attacks.

### 3. Collecting Trust Information

**LDAP Query:**
```
LDAP Search Scope: WholeSubtree
Base Object: dc=[REDACTED],dc=local
Search Filter: (objectCategory=CN=Trusted-Domain,CN=Schema,CN=Configuration,DC=[REDACTED],DC=local)
```
**Description:**
This query targets trust information within the domain, potentially revealing relationships with other domains or forests. Understanding trust configurations is crucial for attackers seeking to exploit trust relationships for unauthorized access.

### 4. Identifying Domain Administrators and Service Principals

**LDAP Query:**
```
LDAP Search Scope: WholeSubtree
Base Object: DC=[REDACTED],DC=local
Search Filter: (&(sAMAccountType=805306368)(servicePrincipalName=*)(!(sAMAccountName=krbtgt))(!(userAccountControl&2))(adminCount=1))
```
**Description:**
By executing this query, threat actors can identify domain administrators and service principals, which are often privileged accounts with extensive access rights. Compromising these accounts can lead to complete control over the domain.

## Mitigating LDAP Query Threats

To mitigate the risks associated with LDAP query reconnaissance, system administrators can implement the following measures:

1. **Access Control:** Limit access to LDAP services and directories to only authorized users. Implement strict access controls based on the principle of least privilege.

2. **Query Monitoring:** Employ robust logging and monitoring solutions to track LDAP queries and detect suspicious activities. Set up alerts for unusual query patterns or excessive data retrieval.

3. **Filtering and Whitelisting:** Implement filters and whitelists to restrict the types of LDAP queries that can be executed. Block or flag queries that match known reconnaissance patterns used by threat actors.

4. **Regular Audits:** Conduct regular audits of LDAP configurations and permissions to ensure compliance with security policies. Identify and remediate any misconfigurations or vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.

5. **Credential Hygiene:** Enforce strong password policies and regularly rotate credentials for privileged accounts. Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to add an extra layer of security.

By proactively implementing these measures, organizations can effectively mitigate the risks posed by LDAP query reconnaissance and enhance the security posture of their Active Directory environments.

1. Review and Restrict Administrator Accounts

Review Current Administrator Accounts:
Conduct a thorough review of existing administrator accounts to assess their necessity and usage.
Remove or disable any administrator accounts that are unnecessary for network management to reduce the attack surface.
Restrict Multiple Administrator Accounts:
Discourage the use of multiple administrator accounts for a single user to minimize the risk of compromise.
2. Segmentation and Least Privilege

Segregate On-Premises and Azure Environments:
Create separate administrator accounts for managing on-premises and Azure environments to segment access and prevent lateral movement.
Implement Least Privilege:
Adhere to the principle of least privilege by granting administrator privileges only to accounts that require them for specific tasks.
Utilize just-in-time (JIT) and just enough access (JEA) to temporarily elevate privileges for the minimum necessary duration to complete authorized tasks.
3. Phishing-Resistant Multifactor Authentication (MFA)

Enable MFA for Remote Access:
Implement phishing-resistant MFA solutions, such as security tokens or hardware keys, to enhance the security of remote access.
Require MFA for accessing sensitive data repositories, webmail services, VPNs, and critical systems.
Utilize MFA for all remote logins to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access.
