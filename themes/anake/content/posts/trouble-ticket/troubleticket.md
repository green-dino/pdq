# [Guide to System Engineering Process](https://github.com/green-dino/ISO_Change_Control_Process/tree/main/Ticketing%20System)

## Introduction

As a systems engineer, your role is crucial in ensuring the stability and reliability of complex systems. This guide will help you understand and navigate the system engineering process using the provided diagram as a reference.

## 1. Increasing the Time Between Failures

The primary goal of a systems engineer is to increase the time between system failures. This can be achieved through the following strategies:

- **Avoid Antipatterns:** Identify and eliminate anti-patterns or common pitfalls in system design and operation that can lead to failures. These may include inefficient resource management, code issues, or architectural problems.

- **Spread Risks:** Diversify system components and resources to minimize the impact of potential failures. Redundancy and load balancing can help achieve this.

- **Adopt Dev Practices:** Implement best development practices such as continuous integration, testing, and automation to enhance system resilience.

## 2. Trouble Tickets

In a system engineering context, trouble tickets are often used to manage system issues and requests. Here's how they are related:

- **Problem:** When a system issue is detected, it can be categorized as a problem. Problems can lead to changes, incidents, or requests.

- **Change:** When a change is required to address a problem or to improve system performance, it involves multiple steps, including implementation and validation.

- **Incident:** Incidents are unexpected events that disrupt system operations. They require investigation and resolution.

- **Request:** Requests are non-incident-related inquiries or service demands that need evaluation and fulfillment.

## 3. Framework

The framework provides a structured approach to system engineering. Here's how various components are connected:

- **Loops:** Loops represent recurring processes in system management. They involve functions, playbooks, and mappings.

- **Functions:** Functions are specific operations or tasks within a system.

- **Mappings:** Mappings establish connections between functions and playbooks, facilitating the automation of routine tasks.

- **Playbooks:** Playbooks are a collection of predefined roles and responsibilities.

- **Roles:** Roles represent the responsibilities assigned to specific individuals or teams in the system engineering process.

## 4. Reducing Time to Detect

Reducing the time it takes to detect issues is crucial for minimizing system downtime. The following strategies are essential:

- **Align:** Ensure that system metrics and performance align with defined Service Level Indicators (SLIs).

- **Fresh Data:** Utilize up-to-date and relevant data for monitoring and analysis to detect issues quickly.

- **Effective Alerts:** Set up effective alerting systems that notify the appropriate personnel when anomalies or issues are detected.

## 5. Relationship between Components

The diagram illustrates the interconnected nature of the system engineering process:

- **Problems:** Problems can lead to various outcomes, including changes, incidents, and requests.

- **Resilience:** Resilience is a key factor in system stability, influencing changes, incidents, requests, and problem resolution.
