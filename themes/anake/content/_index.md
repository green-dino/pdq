# Setting goals
Is an imperative part of a successful organization. Goal establishment does not occur in a vacuum. It is dynamic because the goals selected shape the organization, the outcomes, and the community. Decisions have consequences. The balance of determining the consequences based on the data we have and the way we move forward requires due diligence.

Effective communication regarding data utilization is paramount in aligning metrics and fostering a proactive approach to driving change. As a Civil Servant, part of my role involved the recruitment of employees, both full-time and contract staff, for classified projects aimed at enhancing our nation's security. One such endeavor was the critical task of assembling a team dedicated to the long-term security of the internet, a vital resource for our military. In this capacity, my responsibilities extended beyond the mere selection of individuals. I delved into understanding their compatibility within the team and how their contributions could nurture their own career growth while strengthening the collective effort.
